\chapter*{General conclusion et Perspectives}

For me it was a very nice and wonderful experience to pass my summer internship with the Mind engineering family . It was such an Honor to know these person i have learned a lot of things . 
\\I learned new things such as how to code with php , how to use  AJAX , How to develop a site with wordpress 
.
\\ 
\\ I learned extend also my previous skills and took the to a new level such as jquery , css , javascript , UI frameworks  and mobile developement life cycle .
\\*
But what really made this internship spectacular is to pass a whole 2 months with these people and , learn from their experiences  and to be professional , Timely , And exact like they are .
