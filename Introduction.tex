The major part of news websites have mobile apps aside to them . Since mobile apps are too much portable and easy to use . The push notifications  web services makes building a mobile app  aside to the newspaper website a very suitable solution to make your clients more engaged and loyal to your website . 
 
Hssine bouzara the founder and Director of publication of L'affiche News online news website  has decided to adopt this solution and build own mobile app aside to his website . The mobile demanded application must contain 3 major features: 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Development of a WordPress plugin which is responsible for sending the push notification if any new post is posted on the website . and retrieve data from the database and and encode  them in JSON format . 
  \item News browsing.
  \item Push notification service integration on the app. 
\end{enumerate}

This project was assigned to me during my summer internship at Mind Engineering .
In the next few pages i will talk with details about the context of my project , the client's need and the design and the developement of the application .
