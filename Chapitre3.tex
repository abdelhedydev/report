\section{Choice of development tools}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{DBMS:MySQL} is the dbms already used by L'affiche news website
\item \textbf{Editors:Brackets and Atom } Two open source IDEs characterized  by the massive number of plugins available for these two editors.
\item \textbf{IntelXDK:} is a development kit created by Intel to create native apps for mobile phones and tablets using web technologies like HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. Apps are compiled online via the Cordova platform for making cross-platform apps . i have choose this platform since the required application is Hybrid application

This app is developed using Hybrid mobile apps because it will accelerate the developement and facilitate the developement for the mobile app developer . It will also make the app easy to adapt to ios based smart phones.
